# Selenium Grid Node - Chrome Debug

_This image is only intended for development purposes!_ Runs a Selenium Grid Node with a VNC Server to allow you to visually see the browser being automated. Since it runs additional services to support this it is too heavy weight for usage within a Selenium Grid cluster.

## Dockerfile

[`selenium/node-chrome-debug` Dockerfile](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium/blob/master/NodeChromeDebug/Dockerfile)

## How to use this image

First, you will need a Selenium Grid Hub that the Node will connect to.

```
$ docker run -d -P --name selenium-hub selenium/hub
```

Once the hub is up and running will want to launch nodes that can run tests.

```
$ docker run -d -P --link selenium-hub:hub selenium/node-chrome-debug
```

You can acquire the port that the VNC server is exposed to by running:

``` bash
$ docker port <container-name|container-id> 5900
#=> 0.0.0.0:49338
```

Using RealVNC you can look in view only mode, to avoid accidentally messing up your tests, utilizing our [vncview script](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium/blob/master/bin/vncview).

``` bash
$ ./bin/vncview 127.0.0.1:49338
```

If you are running Boot2Docker on Mac then you already have a [VNC client](http://www.davidtheexpert.com/post.php?id=5) built-in. You can connect by entering `vnc://<boot2docker-ip>:49160` in Safari or [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/)

When you are prompted for the password it is __secret__. If you wish to change this then you should either change it in the `/NodeBase/Dockerfile` and build the images yourself, or you can define a docker image that derives from the posted ones which reconfigures it:

``` dockerfile
FROM selenium/node-chrome-debug:2.53.0

RUN x11vnc -storepasswd <your-password-here> /home/seluser/.vnc/passwd
```

## What is Selenium?
_Selenium automates browsers._ That's it! What you do with that power is entirely up to you. Primarily, it is for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that. Boring web-based administration tasks can (and should!) also be automated as well.

Selenium has the support of some of the largest browser vendors who have taken (or are taking) steps to make Selenium a native part of their browser. It is also the core technology in countless other browser automation tools, APIs and frameworks.

See the Selenium [site](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/) for documation on usage within your test code.

## Getting Help

### User Group

The first place where people ask for help about Selenium is the [Official User Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/selenium-users). Here, you'll find that most of the time, someone already found the problem you are facing right now, and usually reached the solution for which you are looking.

_Note: Please make sure to search the group before asking for something. Your question likely won't get answered if it was previously answered in another discussion!_

### Chat Room

The best place to ask for help is the user group (because they also keep the information accessible for others to read in the future). However, if you have a very important (or too simple) issue that needs a solution ASAP, you can always enter the IRC chat room. You might just find someone ready to help on `#selenium` at [Freenode](https://freenode.net/).
